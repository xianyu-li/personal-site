    <h3>Borscht Assignment</h3>
    <p>Being restricted to only certain html elements, it was kind of difficult because I did not know how to format it. I thoguht we were supposed to make it clear to read so I didn't experiment much with it and just gave it a clear structure. I was more focused on making it coherent rather than giving it a flow to it.</p>

    <h3>Borscht CSS Assignment</h3>
    <p>This second borscht assignment allowed me to explore more with css especially with the position tag. CSS Tricks and w3 school was very useful in giving examples of what some css tags do and experimenting with them in this assignment allowed me to figure it out better.</p>

    <h3>HTML Javascript Assignment</h3>
    <p>Using Javascript was difficult at first but after a lot of reading and searching it became somewhat understandable. At first I had a lot of trouble with how to reference back to the html. What helped the most was experimenting it through trial and error. I still do need some work on experimenting with different ways to reference element.</p>

    <H3>HTML JQuery Assignment</H3>
    <p>One difficult thing with this assignment was trying to remember the template of the structure of JQuery. The amount of brackets were starting to confuse me. I'm still not too sure about using var.</p>

    <H3>Collections Project</H3>
    <p>Quarantine and Javascript dont mix. Biggest headache of my life but it was kinda fun. Always satisfying when you get something the way you want. I did struggle with the arrays and filters and all the brackets and squiggles just start blurring together. </p>
