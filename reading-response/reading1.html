            You, the Users by Kalli Retzepi 
<br />
            What stood out to last semester that my Creative Computing said was that computers are essentially stupid and it was us to instruct it what to do. Computers are intelligent and can do simple tasks faster than we are yet we are able to direct them and tell them what to do but under the wrong type of people it can be detrimental. Although, in my opinion, people become desensitized to what companies have been doing such as data mining and selling that information or tracking us for the sake of convenience. Around two years ago the trivia app HQ cam out where it was a livestream with a live host where you can win money for getting all ten trivia questions right. It came out that HQ was datamining and making a profit from selling it but people still continued to play it, like the government already has our information and our data was probably already tracked through Alexa or Google Home, so how much more can they really get? Our locations are already frequently stored from using Google Maps and our social habits are being tracked through Netflix and Instagram that is being used in their algorithm. It might have to developers or designers to find a way to make people care and aware of the repercussions of data mining.
